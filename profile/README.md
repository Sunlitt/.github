# Sunlitt ☀️

Hello. We are the creators of [Sunlitt](https://apps.apple.com/app/sunlitt/id1628751457), an iOS app that helps you find the direction of the sun at any time of the day, any day of the year, everywhere in the world.

To track the direction of the sun we translated well known math formulas into swifty Swift code and we decided to release it as an open-source library: [SunKit](https://github.com/Sunlitt/SunKit).
